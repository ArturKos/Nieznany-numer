I'll help you. Let me first understand what you're looking for by checking what's in that temporary directory.

✗ Check contents of temporary directory
 $ ls -la /var/folders/34/c3dv9rt94ddchqzgq00_z2gc0000gn/T/tmp6_b51t3x 2>/dev/null || echo
 "Directory not found or empty"
   Permission denied and could not request permission from user

I don't have permission to access that temporary directory. Could you clarify what you'd like me to help you with? Are you asking me to:

1. Review code or files from a specific location?
2. Work on the project in the current repository (`/Users/arturkos/StudioProjects/Nieznany-numer`)?
3. Something else?

Please provide more context about what you need.
